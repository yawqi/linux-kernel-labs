Contributing to linux-kernel-labs
=================================

``linux-kernel-labs`` is an open platform.
You can help it get better by contributing to the documentation, exercises or
the infrastructure.
All contributions are welcome, no matter if they are just fixes for typos or
new sections in the documentation.

All information required for making a contribution can be found in the
`linux-kernel-labs Linux repo <https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux>`_.
In order to change anything, you need to create a Pull Request (``PR``)
from your own fork to this repository.
The PR will be reviewed by the members of the team and will be merged once
any potential issue is fixed.

********************
Repository structure
********************

The `linux-kernel-labs repo <https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux>`_ is
a fork of the Linux kernel repo, with the following additions:

  * ``/tools/labs``: contains the labs and the :ref:`virtual machine (VM) infrastructure<vm_link>`

    * ``tools/labs/templates``: contains the skeletons sources
    * ``tools/labs/qemu``: contains the qemu VM configuration

  * ``/Documentation/teaching``: contains the sources used to generate this
    documentation

**************************
Building the documentation
**************************

To build the documentation, navigate to ``tools/labs`` and run the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

  make docs

.. note::
  The command should install all the required packages.
  In some cases, installing the packages or building the documentation might
  fail, because of broken dependencies versions.

  Instead of struggling to fix the dependencies, the simplest way to build
  the documentation is using a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_.
  First, install ``docker`` and ``docker-compose`` on your host, and then run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     make docker-docs

  The first run might take some time, but subsequent builds will be faster.

Forking the repository
======================

1. If you haven't done it already, clone the
   `linux-kernel-labs repo <https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux>`_
   repository locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ mkdir -p ~/src
     $ git clone git@github.com:linux-kernel-labs/linux.git ~/src/linux

2. Go to https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux, make sure you are logged
   in and click ``Fork`` in the top right of the page.

3. Add the forked repo as a new remote to the local repo:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ git remote add my_fork git@github.com:<your_username>/linux.git

Now, you can push to your fork by using ``my_fork`` instead of ``origin``
(e.g. ``git push my_fork master``).

Creating a pull request
=======================

.. warning::

  Pull requests must be created from their own branches, which are started from
  ``master``.

1. Go to the master branch and make sure you have no local changes:

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git checkout master
    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    nothing to commit, working directory clean


2. Make sure the local master branch is up-to-date with linux-kernel-labs:

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git pull origin master

  .. note::

    You can also push the latest master to your forked repo:

    .. code-block:: bash

      student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git push my_fork master

3. Create a new branch for your change:

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git checkout -b <your_branch_name>

4. Make some changes and commit them. In this example, we are going to change
   ``Documentation/teaching/index.rst``:

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ vim Documentation/teaching/index.rst
    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git add Documentation/teaching/index.rst
    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git commit -m "<commit message>"

  .. warning::

    The commit message must include a relevant description of your change
    and the location of the changed component.

    Examples:

      * ``documentation: index: Fix typo in the first section``
      * ``labs: block_devices: Change printk log level``

5. Push the local branch to your forked repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git push my_fork <your_branch_name>

6. Open the Pull Request

  * Go to https://github.com and open your forked repository page
  * Click ``New pull request``.
  * Make sure base repository (left side) is ``linux-kernel-labs/linux`` and the
    base is master.
  * Make sure the head repository (right side) is your forked repo and the
    compare branch is your pushed branch.
  * Click ``Create pull request``.

Making changes to a Pull Request
================================

After receiving feedback for your changes, you might need to update the Pull
Request.
Your goal is to do a new push on the same branch. For this, follow the next steps:

1. Make sure your branch is still up to date with the ``linux-kernel-labs`` repo
   ``master`` branch.

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git fetch origin master
    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git rebase FETCH_HEAD

  .. note::

    If you are getting conflicts, it means that someone else modified the same
    files/lines as you and already merged the changes since you opened the
    Pull Request.

    In this case, you will need to fix the conflicts by editing the
    conflicting files manually (run ``git status`` to see these files).
    After fixing the conflicts, add them using ``git add`` and then run
    ``git rebase --continue``.


2. Apply the changes to your local files
3. Commit the changes. We want all the changes to be in the same commit, so
   we will amend the changes to the initial commit.

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git add Documentation/teaching/index.rst
    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git commit --amend

4. Force-push the updated commit:

  .. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106:~/src/linux$ git push my_fork <your_branch_name> -f

  After this step, the Pull Request is updated. It is now up to the
  linux-kernel-labs team to review the pull request and integrate your
  contributions in the main project.
