Kernel Modules Overview
=======================

A monolithic kernel, though faster than a microkernel, has the disadvantage of
lack of modularity and extensibility. On modern monolithic kernels, this has
been solved by using kernel modules. A kernel module (or loadable kernel mode)
is an object file that contains code that can extend the kernel functionality
at runtime (it is loaded as needed); When a kernel module is no longer needed,
it can be unloaded. Most of the device drivers are used in the form of kernel
modules.

For the development of Linux device drivers, it is recommended to download the
kernel sources, configure and compile them and then install the compiled version
on the test /development tool machine.

An example of a kernel module
=============================

Below is a very simple example of a kernel module. When loading into the kernel,
it will generate the message :code:`"Hi"`. When unloading the kernel module, the
:code:`"Bye"` message will be generated.

.. code-block:: c

    #include <linux/kernel.h>
    #include <linux/init.h>
    #include <linux/module.h>

    MODULE_DESCRIPTION("My kernel module");
    MODULE_AUTHOR("Me");
    MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

    static int dummy_init(void)
    {
            pr_debug("Hi\n");
            return 0;
    }

    static void dummy_exit(void)
    {
            pr_debug("Bye\n");
    }

    module_init(dummy_init);
    module_exit(dummy_exit);


The generated messages will not be displayed on the console but will be saved
in a specially reserved memory area for this, from where they will be extracted
by the logging daemon (syslog). To display kernel messages, you can use the
:command:`dmesg` command or inspect the logs:

.. code-block:: bash

   # cat /var/log/syslog | tail -2
   Feb 20 13:57:38 asgard kernel: Hi
   Feb 20 13:57:43 asgard kernel: Bye

   # dmesg | tail -2
   Hi
   Bye

Compiling kernel modules
========================

Compiling a kernel module differs from compiling an user program. First, other
headers should be used. Also, the module should not be linked to libraries.
And, last but not least, the module must be compiled with the same options as
the kernel in which we load the module. For these reasons, there is a standard
compilation method (:code:`kbuild`). This method requires the use of two files:
a :file:`Makefile` and a :file:`Kbuild` file.

Below is an example of a :file:`Makefile`:

.. code-block:: bash

   KDIR = /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

   kbuild:
           make -C $(KDIR) M=`pwd`

   clean:
           make -C $(KDIR) M=`pwd` clean

And the example of a :file:`Kbuild` file used to compile a module:

.. code-block:: bash

   EXTRA_CFLAGS = -Wall -g

   obj-m        = modul.o


As you can see, calling :command:`make` on the :file:`Makefile` file in the
example shown will result in the :command:`make` invocation in the kernel
source directory (``/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build``) and referring to the
current directory (``M = `pwd```). This process ultimately leads to reading
the :file:`Kbuild` file from the current directory and compiling the module
as instructed in this file.

.. note:: For labs we will configure different :command:`KDIR`, according to
          the virtual machine specifications:

          .. code-block:: bash

              KDIR = /home/student/src/linux
              [...]

A :file:`Kbuild` file contains one or more directives for compiling a kernel
module.  The easiest example of such a directive is ``obj-m =
module.o``. Following this directive, a kernel module (:code:`ko` - kernel
object) will be created, starting from the ``module.o`` file. ``module.o`` will
be created starting from ``module.c`` or ``module.S``. All of these files can
be found in the :file:`Kbuild`'s directory.

An example of a :file:`Kbuild` file that uses several sub-modules is shown
below:

.. code-block:: bash

   EXTRA_CFLAGS = -Wall -g

   obj-m        = supermodule.o
   supermodule-y = module-a.o module-b.o

For the example above, the steps to compile are:

   * compile the :file:`module-a.c` and :file:`module-b.c` sources,
     resulting in module-a.o and module-b.o objects
   * :file:`module-a.o` and :file:`module-b.o` will then be linked
     in :file:`supermodule.o`
   * from :file:`supermodule.o` will be created :file:`supermodule.ko`
     module


The suffix of targets in :file:`Kbuild` determines how they are used, as
follows:

   * M (modules) is a target for loadable kernel modules

   * Y (yes) represents a target for object files to be compiled and then
     linked to a module (``$(mode_name)-y``) or within the kernel (``obj-y``)

   * any other target suffix will be ignored by :file:`Kbuild` and will not be
     compiled


.. note:: These suffixes are used to easily configure the kernel by running the
          :command:`make menuconfig` command or directly editing the
          :file:`.config` file. This file sets a series of variables that are
          used to determine which features are added to the kernel at build
          time. For example, when adding BTRFS support with :command:`make
          menuconfig`, add the line :code:`CONFIG_BTRFS_FS = y` to the
          :file:`.config` file.  The BTRFS kbuild contains the line
          ``obj-$(CONFIG_BTRFS_FS):= btrfs.o``, which becomes ``obj-y:=
          btrfs.o``. This will compile the :file:`btrfs.o` object and will be
          linked to the kernel. Before the variable was set, the line became
          ``obj:=btrfs.o`` and so it was ignored, and the kernel was build
          without BTRFS support.

For more details, see the :file:`Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt` and
:file:`Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt` files within the kernel sources.

  _[SECTION-LOAD-MODULES-BEGIN]

Loading/unloading a kernel module
=================================

To load a kernel module, use the :command:`insmod` utility. This utility
receives as a parameter the path to the :file:`*.ko` file in which the module
was compiled and linked.  Unloading the module from the kernel is done using
the :command:`rmmod` command, which receives the module name as a parameter.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ insmod module.ko
   $ rmmod module.ko

When loading the kernel module, the routine specified as a parameter of the
``module_init`` macro will be executed. Similarly, when the module is unloaded
the routine specified as a parameter of the ``module_exit`` will be executed.

A complete example of compiling and loading/unloading a kernel module is
presented below:

.. code-block:: bash

   faust:~/lab-01/modul-lin# ls
   Kbuild  Makefile  modul.c

   faust:~/lab-01/modul-lin# make
   make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`

   Hi

   faust:~/lab-01/modul-lin# rmmod modul

   faust:~/lab-01/modul-lin# dmesg | tail -2
   Hi
   Bye

Information about modules loaded into the kernel can be found using the
:command:`lsmod` command or by inspecting the :file:`/proc/modules`,
:file:`/sys/module` directories.

Kernel Module Debugging
=======================

Troubleshooting a kernel module is much more complicated than debugging a
regular program. First, a mistake in a kernel module can lead to blocking the
entire system. Troubleshooting is therefore much slowed down. To avoid reboot,
it is recommended to use a virtual machine (qemu, virtualbox, vmware).

When a module containing bugs is inserted into the kernel, it will eventually
generate a `kernel oops <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_oops>`_.
A kernel oops is an invalid operation detected by the kernel and can only
be generated by the kernel. For a stable kernel version, it almost certainly
means that the module contains a bug. After the oops appears, the kernel will
continue to work.

Very important to the appearance of a kernel oops is saving the generated
message. As noted above, messages generated by the kernel are saved in logs and
can be displayed with the :command:`dmesg` command. To make sure that no kernel
message is lost, it is recommended to insert/test the kernel directly from the
console, or periodically check the kernel messages. Noteworthy is that an oops
can occur because of a programming error, but also a because of hardware error.

If a fatal error occurs, after which the system can not return to a stable
state, a `kernel panic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_panic>`_ is
generated.

Look at the kernel module below that contains a bug that generates an oops:

.. code-block:: c

    /*
     * Oops generating kernel module
     */

    #include <linux/kernel.h>
    #include <linux/module.h>
    #include <linux/init.h>

    MODULE_DESCRIPTION ("Oops");
    MODULE_LICENSE ("GPL");
    MODULE_AUTHOR ("PSO");

    #define OP_READ         0
    #define OP_WRITE        1
    #define OP_OOPS         OP_WRITE

    static int my_oops_init (void)
    {
            int *a;

            a = (int *) 0x00001234;
    #if OP_OOPS == OP_WRITE
            *a = 3;
    #elif OP_OOPS == OP_READ
            printk (KERN_ALERT "value = %d\n", *a);
    #else
    #error "Unknown op for oops!"
    #endif

            return 0;
    }

    static void my_oops_exit (void)
    {
    }

    module_init (my_oops_init);
    module_exit (my_oops_exit);

.. **

Inserting this module into the kernel will generate an oops:

Although relatively cryptic, the message provided by the kernel to the
appearance of an oops provides valuable information about the error. First line:

.. code-block:: bash

   BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 00001234
   EIP: [<c89d4005>] my_oops_init + 0x5 / 0x20 [oops]

Tells us the cause and the address of the instruction that generated the error.
In our case this is an invalid access to memory.

Next line

   ``Oops: 0002 [# 1] PREEMPT DEBUG_PAGEALLOC``

Tells us that it's the first oops (#1). This is important in the context that
an oops can lead to other oopses. Usually only the first oops is relevant.
Furthermore, the oops code (``0002``) provides information about the error type
(see :file:`arch/x86/include/asm/trap_pf.h`):


   * Bit 0 == 0 means no page found, 1 means protection fault
   * Bit 1 == 0 means read, 1 means write
   * Bit 2 == 0 means kernel, 1 means user mode

In this case, we have a write access that generated the oops (bit 1 is 1).

Below is a dump of the registers. It decodes the instruction pointer (``EIP``)
value and notes that the bug appeared in the :code:`my_oops_init` function with
a 5-byte offset (``EIP: [<c89d4005>] my_oops_init+0x5``). The message also
shows the stack content and a backtrace of calls until then.

If an invalid read call is generated (``#define OP_OOPS OP_READ``), the message
will be the same, but the oops code will differ, which would now be ``0000``:

.. code-block:: bash

   faust:~/lab-01/modul-oops# dmesg | tail -33

objdump
-------

Detailed information about the instruction that generated the oops can be found
using the :command:`objdump` utility. Useful options to use are :command:`-d`
to disassemble the code and :command:`-S` for interleaving C code in assembly
language code.  For efficient decoding, however, we need the address where the
kernel module was loaded. This can be found in :file:`/proc/modules`.

Here's an example of using :command:`objdump` on the above module to identify
the instruction that generated the oops:

   c89d4021:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
   }
   c89d4023:       5d                      pop    %ebp
   c89d4024:       c3                      ret
   c89d4025:       90                      nop
   c89d4026:       90                      nop
   c89d4027:       90                      nop

Note that the instruction that generated the oops (``c89d4005`` identified
earlier) is:

  ``C89d4005: c7 05 34 12 00 00 03 movl $ 0x3,0x1234``

That is exactly what was expected - storing value 3 at 0x0001234.

The :file:`/proc/modules` is used to find the address where a kernel module is
loaded.  The :command:`--adjust-vma` option allows you to display instructions
relative to ``0xc89d4000``. The :command:`-l` option displays the number of
each line in the source code interleaved with the assembly language code.

addr2line
---------

A more simplistic way to find the code that generated an oops is to use the
:command:`addr2line` utility:

.. code-block:: bash

   faust:~/lab-01/modul-oops# addr2line -e oops.o 0x5
   /root/lab-01/modul-oops/oops.c:23

Where ``0x5`` is the value of the program counter (``EIP = c89d4005``) that
generated the oops, minus the base address of the module (``0xc89d4000``)
according to :file:`/proc/modules`

minicom
-------

:command:`Minicom` (or other equivalent utilities, eg :command:`picocom`,
:command:`screen`) is a utility that can be used to connect and interact with a
serial port. The serial port is the basic method for analyzing kernel messages
or interacting with an embedded system in the development phase. There are two
more common ways to connect:

* a serial port where the device we are going to use is :file:`/dev/ttyS0`

* a serial USB port (FTDI) in which case the device we are going to use is
  :file:`/dev/ttyUSB`.

For the virtual machine used in the lab, the device that we need to use is
displayed after the virtual machine starts:

.. code-block:: bash

    char device redirected to /dev/pts/20 (label virtiocon0)

Minicom use:

.. code-block:: bash

   #for connecting via COM1 and using a speed of 115,200 characters per second
   minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyS0

   #For USB serial port connection
   minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

   #To connect to the serial port of the virtual machine
   minicom -D /dev/pts/20

netconsole
----------

:command:`Netconsole` is a utility that allows logging of kernel debugging
messages over the network. This is useful when the disk logging system does not
work or when serial ports are not available or when the terminal does not
respond to commands. :command:`Netconsole` comes in the form of a kernel
module.

To work, it needs the following parameters:

   * port, IP address, and the source interface name of the debug station
   * port, MAC address, and IP address of the machine to which the debug
     messages will be sent

These parameters can be configured when the module is inserted into the kernel,
or even while the module is inserted if it has been compiled with the
``CONFIG_NETCONSOLE_DYNAMIC`` option.

An example configuration when inserting :command:`netconsole` kernel module is
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   alice:~# modprobe netconsole netconsole=6666@192.168.191.130/eth0,6000@192.168.191.1/00:50:56:c0:00:08

Thus, the debug messages on the station that has the address
``192.168.191.130`` will be sent to the ``eth0`` interface, having source port
``6666``. The messages will be sent to ``192.168.191.1`` with the MAC address
``00:50:56:c0:00:08``, on port ``6000``.

Messages can be played on the destination station using :command:`netcat`:

.. code-block:: bash

   bob:~ # nc -l -p 6000 -u

Alternatively, the destination station can configure :command:`syslogd` to
intercept these messages. More information can be found in
:file:`Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt`.

Printk debugging
----------------

``The two oldest and most useful debugging aids are Your Brain and Printf``.

For debugging, a primitive way is often used, but it is quite effective:
:code:`printk` debugging. Although a debugger can also be used, it is generally
not very useful: simple bugs (uninitialized variables, memory management
problems, etc.)  can be easily localized by control messages and the
kernel-decoded oop message.

For more complex bugs, even a debugger can not help us too much unless the
operating system structure is very well understood. When debugging a kernel
module, there are a lot of unknowns in the equation: multiple contexts (we have
multiple processes and threads running at a time), interruptions, virtual
memory, etc.

You can use :code:`printk` to display kernel messages to user space. It is
similar to :code:`printf`'s functionality; the only difference is that the
transmitted message can be prefixed with a string of :code:`"<n>"`, where
:code:`n` indicates the error level (loglevel) and has values between ``0`` and
``7``. Instead of :code:`"<n>"`, the levels can also be coded by symbolic
constants:

.. code-block:: c

    KERN_EMERG - n = 0
    KERN_ALERT - n = 1
    KERN_CRIT - n = 2
    KERN_ERR - n = 3
    KERN_WARNING - n = 4
    KERN_NOTICE - n = 5
    KERN_INFO - n = 6
    KERN_DEBUG - n = 7


The definitions of all log levels are found in :file:`linux/kern_levels.h`.
Basically, these log levels are used by the system to route messages sent to
various outputs: console, log files in :file:`/var/log` etc.

.. note:: To display :code:`printk` messages in user space, the :code:`printk`
          log level must be of higher priority than `console_loglevel`
          variable. The default console log level can be configured from
          :file:`/proc/sys/kernel/printk`.

          For instance, the command:

          .. code-block:: bash

              echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk

          will enable all the kernel log messages to be displayed in the
          console. That is, the logging level has to be strictly less than the
          :code:`console_loglevel` variable. For example, if the
          :code:`console_loglevel` has a value of ``5`` (specific to
          :code:`KERN_NOTICE`), only messages with loglevel stricter than ``5``
          (i.e :code:`KERN_EMERG`, :code:`KERN_ALERT`, :code:`KERN_CRIT`,
          :code:`KERN_ERR`, :code:`KERN_WARNING`) will be shown.

Console-redirected messages can be useful for quickly viewing the effect of
executing the kernel code, but they are no longer so useful if the kernel
encounters an irreparable error and the system freezes. In this case, the logs
of the system must be consulted, as they keep the information between system
restarts. These are found in :file:`/var/log` and are text files, populated by
:code:`syslogd` and :code:`klogd` during the kernel run. :code:`syslogd` and
:code:`klogd` take the information from the virtual file system mounted in
:file:`/proc`. In principle, with :code:`syslogd` and :code:`klogd` turned on,
all messages coming from the kernel will go to :file:`/var/log/kern.log`.

A simpler version for debugging is using the :file:`/var/log/debug` file.  It
is populated only with the :code:`printk` messages from the kernel with the
:code:`KERN_DEBUG` log level.

Given that a production kernel (similar to the one we're probably running with)
contains only release code, our module is among the few that send messages
prefixed with KERN_DEBUG . In this way, we can easily navigate through the
:file:`/var/log/debug` information by finding the messages corresponding to a
debugging session for our module.

Such an example would be the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clear the debug file of previous information (or possibly a backup)
    $ echo "New debug session" > /var/log/debug
    # Run the tests
    # If there is no critical error causing a panic kernel, check the output
    # if a critical error occurs and the machine only responds to a restart,
      restart the system and check /var/log/debug.

The format of the messages must obviously contain all the information of
interest in order to detect the error, but inserting in the code :code:`printk`
to provide detailed information can be as time-consuming as writing the code to
solve the problem. This is usually a trade-off between the completeness of the
debugging messages displayed using :code:`printk` and the time it takes to
insert these messages into the text.

A very simple way, less time-consuming for inserting :code:`printk` and
providing the possibility to analyze the flow of instructions for tests is the
use of the predefined constants :code:`__FILE__`, :code:`__LINE__` and
:code:`__func__`:

    * ``__FILE__`` is replaced by the compiler with the name of the source file
      it is currently being compiled.

    * ``__LINE__`` is replaced by the compiler with the line number on which the
      current instruction is found in the current source file.

    * ``__func__`` /``__FUNCTION__`` is replaced by the compiler with the name
      of the function in which the current instruction is found.

.. note::
    :code:`__FILE__` and :code:`__LINE__` are part of the ANSI C specifications:
    :code:`__func__` is part of specification C99; :code:`__FUNCTION__` is a GNU
    :code:`C` extension and is not portable; However, since we write code for the
    :code:`Linux` kernel, we can use it without any problems.

The following macro definition can be used in this case:

.. code-block:: c

   #define PRINT_DEBUG \
          printk (KERN_DEBUG "[% s]: FUNC:% s: LINE:% d \ n", __FILE__,
                  __FUNCTION__, __LINE__)

Then, at each point where we want to see if it is "reached" in execution,
insert PRINT_DEBUG; This is a simple and quick way, and can yield by carefully
analyzing the output.

The :command:`dmesg` command is used to view the messages printed with
:code:`printk` but not appearing on the console.

To delete all previous messages from a log file, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cat /dev/null > /var/log/debug

To delete messages displayed by the :command:`dmesg` command, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    dmesg -c


Dynamic debugging
-----------------

Dynamic `dyndbg <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.html>`_
debugging enables dynamic debugging activation/deactivation.
Unlike :code:`printk`, it offers more advanced :code:`printk` options for the
messages we want to display; it is very useful for complex modules or
troubleshooting subsystems.
This significantly reduces the amount of messages displayed, leaving only
those relevant for the debug context. To enable ``dyndbg``, the kernel must be
compiled with the ``CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG`` option. Once configured,
:code:`pr_debug()`, :code:`dev_dbg()` and :code:`print_hex_dump_debug()`,
:code:`print_hex_dump_bytes()` can be dynamically enabled per call.

The :file:`/sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control` file from the debugfs (where
:file:`/sys/kernel/debug` is the path to which debugfs was mounted) is used to
filter messages or to view existing filters.

.. code-block:: c

   mount -t debugfs none /debug

`Debugfs <http://opensourceforu.com/2010/10/debugging-linux-kernel-with-debugfs/>`_
is a simple file system, used as a kernel-space interface and
user-space interface to configure different debug options. Any debug utility
can create and use its own files /folders in debugfs.

For example, to display existing filters in ``dyndbg``, you will use:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /debug/dynamic_debug/control

And to enable the debug message from line ``1603`` in the :file:`svcsock.c` file:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo 'file svcsock.c line 1603 +p' > /debug/dynamic_debug/control

The :file:`/debug/dynamic_debug/control` file is not a regular file. It shows
the ``dyndbg`` settings on the filters. Writing in it with an echo will change
these settings (it will not actually make a write). Be aware that the file
contains settings for ``dyndbg`` debugging messages. Do not log in this file.

Dyndbg Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``func`` - just the debug messages from the functions that have the same
  name as the one defined in the filter.

  .. code-block:: bash

      echo 'func svc_tcp_accept +p' > /debug/dynamic_debug/control

* ``file`` - the name of the file(s) for which we want to display the debug
  messages. It can be just the source name, but also the absolute path or
  kernel-tree path.

  .. code-block:: bash

    file svcsock.c
    file kernel/freezer.c
    file /usr/src/packages/BUILD/sgi-enhancednfs-1.4/default/net/sunrpc/svcsock.c

* ``module`` - module name.

  .. code-block:: bash

     module sunrpc

* ``format`` - only messages whose display format contains the specified string.

  .. code-block:: bash

     format "nfsd: SETATTR"

* ``line`` - the line or lines for which we want to enable debug calls.

  .. code-block:: bash

     # Triggers debug messages between lines 1603 and 1605 in the svcsock.c file
     $ echo 'file svcsock.c line 1603-1605 +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
     # Enables debug messages from the beginning of the file to line 1605
     $ echo 'file svcsock.c line -1605 +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

In addition to the above options, a series of flags can be added, removed, or set
with operators ``+``, ``-`` or ``=``:

   * ``p`` activates the pr_debug() .
   * ``f`` includes the name of the function in the printed message.
   * ``l`` includes the line number in the printed message.
   * ``m`` includes the module name in the printed message.
   * ``t`` includes the thread id if it is not called from interrupt context
   * ``_`` no flag is set.

KDB: Kernel debugger
--------------------

The kernel debugger has proven to be very useful to facilitate the development and
debugging process. One of its main advantages is the possibility to perform live debugging.
This allows us to monitor, in real time, the accesses to memory or even modify the memory
while debugging.
The debugger has been integrated in the mainline kernel starting with version 2.6.26-rci.
KDB is not a *source debugger*, but for a complete analysis it can be used in parallel with
gdb and symbol files -- see :ref:`the GDB debugging section <gdb_intro>`

To use KDB, you have the following options:

 * non-usb keyboard + VGA text console
 * serial port console
 * USB EHCI debug port

For the lab, we will use a serial interface connected to the host.
The following command will activate GDB over the serial port:

.. code-block:: bash

  echo hvc0 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc

KDB is a *stop mode debugger*, which means that, while it is active, all the other processes
are stopped. The kernel can be *forced* to enter KDB during execution using the following
`SysRq <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key>`__ command

.. code-block:: bash

  echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger

or by using the key combination ``Ctrl+O g`` in a terminal connected to the serial port
(for example using :command:`minicom`).

KDB has various commands to control and define the context of the debugged system:

 * lsmod, ps, kill, dmesg, env, bt (backtrace)
 * dump trace logs
 * hardware breakpoints
 * modifying memory

For a better description of the available commands you can use the ``help`` command in
the KDB shell.
In the next example, you can notice a simple KDB usage example which sets a hardware
breakpoint to monitor the changes of the ``mVar`` variable.

.. code-block:: bash

  # trigger KDB
  echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
  # or if we are connected to the serial port issue
  Ctrl-O g
  # breakpoint on write access to the mVar variable
  kdb> bph mVar dataw
  # return from KDB
  kdb> go

Exercises
=========

.. _exercises_summary:

.. include:: ../labs/exercises-summary.hrst
.. |LAB_NAME| replace:: kernel_modules

0. Intro
--------

Using :command:`cscope` or |LXR|_ find the definitions of the following symbols
in the Linux kernel source code:

* :c:func:`module_init` and :c:func:`module_exit`

  - what do the two macros do? What is ``init_module`` and ``cleanup_module``?

* :c:data:`ignore_loglevel`

  - What is this variable used for?

.. warning::
  If you have problems using :command:`cscope`, it is possible that the database
  is not generated.  To generate it, use the following command in the kernel
  directory:

  .. code-block:: bash

    make ARCH=x86 cscope

.. note::
  When searching for a structure using :command:`cscope`, use only the
  structure name (without :code:`struct`).  So, to search for the
  structure :c:type:`struct module`, you will use the command

   .. code-block:: bash

     vim -t module

  or, in :command:`vim`, the command

   .. code-block:: bash

     :cs f g module

.. note::
  For more info on using :command:`cscope`, read the
  :ref:`cscope section <cscope_intro>` in the previous lab.

..
  _[EXERCISE1-BEGIN]

1. Kernel module
----------------

To work with the kernel modules, we will follow the steps described
:ref:`above <exercises_summary>`.

Generate the skeleton for the task named **1-2-test-mod** then build and
copy the module to the VM, by running the following commands in
:file:`tools/labs`.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ LABS=kernel_modules make skels
  $ make build
  $ make copy

These commands will build and copy all the modules in the current
lab skeleton.

.. warning::
  Until after solving exercise 3, you will get a compilation error for
  ``3-error-mod``. To avoid this issue, remove the directory
  :file:`skels/kernel_modules/3-error-mod/` and remove the corresponding
  line from ``skels/Kbuild``.

Start the VM using :command:`make boot`, connect to the serial console
using `minicom -D serial.pts` and perform the following tasks:

* load the kernel module.

* list the kernel modules and check if current module is present

* unload the kernel module

* view the messages displayed at loading/unloading the kernel module using
  :command:`dmesg` command

.. note:: Read `Loading/unloading a kernel module`_ section. When unloading
          a kernel module, you can specify only the module name
          (without extension).

..

..
  _[EXERCISE2-BEGIN]


2. Printk
---------

Watch the virtual machine console. Why were the messages displayed directly
to the virtual machine console?

Configure the system such that the messages are not displayed directly
on the serial console, and they can only be inspected using ``dmesg``.

.. hint:: One option is to set the console log level by writting
          the desired level to ``/proc/sys/kernel/printk``.
          Use a value smaller than the level used for the prints in
          the source code of the module.

Load/unload the module again.
The messages should not be printed to the virtual machine console,
but they should be visible when running ``dmesg``.

..
  _[EXERCISE2-END]

..
  _[EXERCISE3-BEGIN]

3. Error
--------

Generate the skeleton for the task named **3-error-mod**. Compile the
sources and get the corresponding kernel module.

Why have compilation
errors occurred? **Hint:** How does this module differ from the previous module?

Modify the module to solve the cause of those errors, then compile and test
the module.

..
  _[EXERCISE3-END]

..
  _[EXERCISE4-BEGIN]

4. Sub-modules
--------------

Inspect the C source files ``mod1.c`` and ``mod2.c`` in :file:`4-multi-mod/`.
Module 2 contains only the definition of a function used by module 1.

Change the :file:`Kbuild` file to create the ``multi_mod.ko`` module from the
two C source files.

.. hint:: Read the `Compiling kernel modules`_ section of the lab.

Compile, copy, boot the VM, load and unload the kernel module. Make sure messages
are properly displayed on the console.

..
  _[EXERCISE4-END]

..
  _[EXERCISE5-BEGIN]

5. Kernel oops
--------------

Enter the directory for the task **5-oops-mod** and inspect the
C source file. Notice where the problem will occur. Add the compilation flag
``-g`` in the Kbuild file.

.. hint:: Read `Compiling kernel modules`_  section of the lab.

Compile the corresponding module and load it into the kernel. Identify the memory
address at which the oops appeared.

.. hint:: Read `Debugging`_ section of the lab.  To identify the
          address, follow the oops message and extract the value of
          the instructions pointer (``EIP``) register.

Determine which instruction has triggered the oops.

.. hint:: Use the :file:`proc/modules` information to get the load address of
          the kernel module.  Use, on the physical machine, objdump
          and/or addr2line . Objdump needs debugging support for
          compilation!  Read the lab's `objdump`_ and `addr2line`_
          sections.

Try to unload the kernel module. Notice that the operation does not
work because there are references from the kernel module within the
kernel since the oops; Until the release of those references (which is
almost impossible in the case of an oops), the module can not be
unloaded.

..
  _[EXERCISE5-END]

..
  _[EXERCISE6-BEGIN]

6. Module parameters
--------------------

Enter the directory for the task **6-cmd-mod** and inspect the C
``cmd_mod.c`` source file. Compile and copy the associated module and
load the kernel module to see the printk message. Then unload the
module from the kernel.

Without modifying the sources, load the kernel module so that the
message shown is ``Early bird gets tired``.

.. hint:: The str variable can be changed by passing a parameter to
          the module. Find more information `here
          <http://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/x323.html>`_.

.. _proc-info:

..
  _[EXERCISE6-END]

..
  _[EXERCISE7-BEGIN]

7. Proc info
------------

Check the skeleton for the task named **7-list-proc**. Add code to
display the Process ID (``PID``) and the executable name for the current
process.

Follow the commands marked with ``TODO``.
The information must be displayed both when loading and unloading the
module.

.. note::
          * In the Linux kernel, a process is described by the
            :c:type:`struct task_struct`.  Use |LXR|_ or ``cscope`` to find the
            definition of :c:type:`struct task_struct`.

          * To find the structure field that contains the name of the
            executable, look for the "executable" comment.

          * The pointer to the structure of the current process
            running at a given time in the kernel is given by the
            :c:macro:`current` variable (of the type
            :c:type:`struct task_struct*`).

.. hint:: To use :c:macro:`current` you'll need to include the header
          in which the :c:type:`struct task_struct` is defined, i.e
          ``linux/sched.h``.

Compile, copy, boot the VM and load the module. Unload the kernel module.

Repeat the loading/unloading operation. Note that the PIDs of the
displayed processes differ. This is because a process is created
from the executable :file:`/sbin/insmod` when the module is loaded and
when the module is unloaded a process is created from the executable
:file:`/sbin/rmmod`.

  _[EXTRA-EXERCISE-BEGIN]

Extra Exercises
===============

1. KDB
------

Go to the **8-kdb** directory. Activate KDB over the serial port and enter KDB
mode using :command:`SysRq`. Connect to the pseudo-terminal linked to virtiocon0
using :command:`minicom`, configure KDB to use the hvc0 serial port:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo hvc0 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc

and enable it using SysRq (:command:`Ctrl + O g`).
Review the current system status (:command:`help` to see the available KDB
commands). Continue the kernel execution using the :command:`go` command.

Load the :file:`hello_kdb` module.
The module will simulate a bug when writing to the :file:`/proc/hello_kdb_bug`
file. To simulate a bug, use the below command:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo 1 > /proc/hello_kdb_bug

After running the above command, at every oops/panic the kernel stops the
execution and enters debug mode.

Analyze the stacktrace and determine the code that generated the bug.
How can we find out from KDB the address where the module was loaded?

In parallel, use GDB in a new window to view the code based on KDB information.

.. hint::
    Load the symbol file. Use :command:`info line`.

When writing to :file:`/proc/hello_kdb_break`, the module will increment the
:c:data:`kdb_write_address` variable. Enter KDB and set a breakpoint for each
write access of the :c:data:`kdb_write_address` variable.
Return to kernel to trigger a write using:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo 1 > /proc/hello_kdb_break

2. PS Module
------------

Update the created kernel module at :ref:`proc-info` in order to display
information about all the processes in the system, when inserting the kernel
module, not just about the current process. Afterwards, compare the obtained
result with the output of the :command:`ps` command.

.. hint::
    * Processes in the system are structured in a circular list.

    * :c:macro:`for_each _...` macros (such as :c:macro:`for_each_process`) are
      useful when you want to navigate the items in a list.

    * To understand how to use a feature or a macro, use |LXR|_ or Vim and
      :command:`cscope` and search for usage scenarios.

3. Memory Info
--------------

Create a kernel module that displays the virtual memory areas of the current
process; for each memory area it will display the start address and the end
address.

.. hint::
    * Start from an existing kernel module.

    * Investigate the structures :c:type:`struct task_struct`,
      :c:type:`struct mm_struct` and :c:type:`struct vm_area_struct`. A
      memory area is indicated by a structure of type :c:type:`struct
      vm_area_struct`.

    * Don't forget to include the headers where the necessary structures are
      defined.

4. Dynamic Debugging
--------------------

Go to the **9-dyndbg** directory and compile the :code:`dyndbg.ko` module.

Familiarize yourself with the :code:`debugfs` file system mounted in
:file:`/debug` and analyze the contents of the file
:file:`/debug/dynamic_debug/control`. Insert the :code:`dyndbg.ko` module and
notice the new content of the :file:`dynamic_debug/control` file.

What appears extra in the respective file? Run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    grep dyndbg /debug/dynamic_debug/control

Configure :command:`dyndbg` so that only messages marked as "Important" in
:c:func:`my_debug_func` function are displayed when the module is unloaded.
The exercise will only filter out the :c:func:`pr_debug` calls; :c:func:`printk`
calls being always displayed.

Specify two ways to filter.

.. hint::
    Read the `Dynamic debugging`_ section and look at the :command:`dyndbg`
    options (for example, :command:`line`, :command:`format`).

Perform the filtering and revise the :file:`dynamic_debug/control` file. What
has changed? How do you know which calls are activated?

.. hint::
    Check the :command:`dyndbg` flags. Unload the kernel module and observe the
    log messages.

5. Dynamic Debugging During Initialization
------------------------------------------

As you have noticed, :c:func:`pr_debug` calls can only be activated /filtered
after module insertion. In some situations, it might be helpful to view the
messages from the initialization of the module. This can be done by using a
default (fake) parameter called :command:`dyndbg` that can be passed as an
argument to initialize the module. With this parameter you can add /delete
:command:`dyndbg` flags.

.. hint::
    Read the last part of the `Dynamic debugging`_ section and see the available
    flags (e.g.: :command:`+/- p`).

Read the `Debug Messages section at Module Initialization Time
<https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.html#debug-messages-at-module-initialization-time>`_
and insert the module so that the messages in :c:func:`my_debug_func` (called
:c:func:`dyndbg_init`) are also displayed during initialization.

.. warning::
    In the VM from the lab, you will need to use :command:`insmod` instead of
    :command:`modprobe`.

Without unloading the module, deactivate :c:func:`pr_debug` calls.

.. hint::
    You can delete the set flags. Unload the kernel module.
