Overview
========

The development of the Internet has led to an exponential increase in network
applications and, as a consequence, to increasing the speed and productivity
requirements of an operating system's networking subsystem. The networking
subsystem is not an essential component of an operating system kernel (the Linux
kernel can be compiled without networking support). It is, however, quite
unlikely for a computing system (or even an embedded device) to have a
non-networked operating system due to the need for connectivity. Modern operating
systems use the `TCP/IP stack
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite>`_. Their kernel
implements protocols up to the transport layer, while application layer protocols
are typically implemented in user space (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.).

Networking in user space
------------------------

In user space the abstraction of network communication is the socket. The
socket abstracts a communication channel and is the kernel-based TCP/IP stack
interaction interface. An IP socket is associated with an IP address, the
transport layer protocol used (TCP, UDP etc) and a port. Common function calls
that use sockets are: creation (``socket``), initialization
(``bind``), connecting (``connect``), waiting for a connection
(``listen``, ``accept``), closing a socket (``close``).

Network communication is accomplished via ``read``/``write`` or ``recv``/``send`` calls
for TCP sockets and ``recvfrom``/``sendto`` for UDP sockets. Transmission and
reception operations are transparent to the application, leaving encapsulation
and transmission over network at the kernel's discretion. However, it is
possible to implement the TCP/IP stack in user space using raw sockets (the
``PF_PACKET`` option when creating a socket), or implementing an application
layer protocol in kernel (`TUX web server
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUX_web_server>`_).

For more details about user space programming using sockets, see `Beej's Guide to
Network Programming Using Internet
Sockets <https://www.beej.us/guide/bgnet/>`_.

Linux networking
================

The Linux kernel provides three basic structures for working with network
packets: :c:type:`struct socket`, :c:type:`struct sock` and :c:type:`struct
sk_buff`.

The first two are abstractions of a socket:

  * :c:type:`struct socket` is an abstraction very close to user space, ie `BSD
    sockets <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets>`_ used to program
    network applications;
  * :c:type:`struct sock` or *INET socket* in Linux terminology is the network
    representation of a socket.

The two structures are related: the :c:type:`struct socket` contains an INET
socket field, and the :c:type:`struct sock` has a BSD socket that holds it.

The :c:type:`struct sk_buff` structure is the representation of a network packet
and its status. The structure is created when a kernel packet is received,
either from the user space or from the network interface.

The :c:type:`struct socket` structure
-------------------------------------

The :c:type:`struct socket` structure is the kernel representation of a BSD
socket, the operations that can be executed on it are similar to those offered
by the kernel (through system calls). Common operations with sockets
(creation, initialization/bind, closing, etc.) result in specific system
calls; they work with the :c:type:`struct socket` structure.

The :c:type:`struct socket` operations are described in :file:`net/socket.c` and
are independent of the protocol type. The :c:type:`struct socket` structure is thus
a generic interface over particular network operations implementations.
Typically, the names of these operations begin with the ``sock_`` prefix.

.. _SocketStructOps:

Operations on the socket structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Socket operations are:

Creation
""""""""

Creation is similar to calling the :c:func:`socket` function in user space, but the
:c:type:`struct socket` created will be stored in the ``res`` parameter:

  * ``int sock_create(int family, int type, int protocol, struct socket **res)``
    creates a socket after the :c:func:`socket` system call;
  * ``int sock_create_kern(struct net *net, int family, int type, int protocol,
    struct socket **res)`` creates a kernel socket;
  * ``int sock_create_lite(int family, int type, int protocol, struct socket **res)``
    creates a kernel socket without parameter sanity checks.

The parameters of these calls are as follows:

  * ``net``, where it is present, used as reference to the network namespace used;
    we will usually initialize it with ``init_net``;
  * ``family`` represents the family of protocols used in the transfer of
    information; they usually begin with the ``PF_`` (Protocol Family) string;
    the constants representing the family of protocols used are found in
    :file:`linux/socket.h`, of which the most commonly used is ``PF_INET``, for
    TCP/IP protocols;
  * ``type`` is the type of socket; the constants used for this parameter are
    found in :file:`linux/net.h`, of which the most used are ``SOCK_STREAM`` for
    a connection based source-to-destination communication and ``SOCK_DGRAM``
    for connectionless communication;
  * ``protocol`` represents the protocol used and is closely related to the
    ``type`` parameter; the constants used for this parameter are found in
    :file:`linux/in.h`, of which the most used are ``IPPROTO_TCP`` for TCP and
    ``IPPROTO_UDP`` for UDP.

To create a TCP socket in kernel space, you must call:

.. code-block:: c

  	struct socket *sock;
  	int err;

  	err = sock_create_kern(&init_net, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP, &sock);
  	if (err < 0) {
  		/* handle error */
  	}

and for creating UDP sockets:

.. code-block:: c

  	struct socket *sock;
  	int err;

  	err = sock_create_kern(&init_net, PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP, &sock);
  	if (err < 0) {
  		/* handle error */
  	}

A usage sample is part of the :c:func:`sys_socket` system call handler:

.. code-block:: c

  SYSCALL_DEFINE3(socket, int, family, int, type, int, protocol)
  {
  	int retval;
  	struct socket *sock;
  	int flags;

  	/* Check the SOCK_* constants for consistency.  */
  	BUILD_BUG_ON(SOCK_CLOEXEC != O_CLOEXEC);
  	BUILD_BUG_ON((SOCK_MAX | SOCK_TYPE_MASK) != SOCK_TYPE_MASK);
  	BUILD_BUG_ON(SOCK_CLOEXEC & SOCK_TYPE_MASK);
  	BUILD_BUG_ON(SOCK_NONBLOCK & SOCK_TYPE_MASK);

  	flags = type & ~SOCK_TYPE_MASK;
  	if (flags & ~(SOCK_CLOEXEC | SOCK_NONBLOCK))
  		return -EINVAL;
  	type &= SOCK_TYPE_MASK;

  	if (SOCK_NONBLOCK != O_NONBLOCK && (flags & SOCK_NONBLOCK))
  		flags = (flags & ~SOCK_NONBLOCK) | O_NONBLOCK;

  	retval = sock_create(family, type, protocol, &sock);
  	if (retval < 0)
  		goto out;

  	return sock_map_fd(sock, flags & (O_CLOEXEC | O_NONBLOCK));
  }

Closing
"""""""

Close connection (for sockets using connection) and release associated
resources:

  * ``void sock_release(struct socket *sock)`` calls the ``release`` function in
    the ``ops`` field of the socket structure:

.. code-block:: c

  void sock_release(struct socket *sock)
  {
  	if (sock->ops) {
  		struct module *owner = sock->ops->owner;

  		sock->ops->release(sock);
  		sock->ops = NULL;
  		module_put(owner);
  	}
  	//...
  }

Sending/receiving messages
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The messages are sent/received using the following functions:

  * ``int sock_recvmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, int flags);``
  * ``int kernel_recvmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, struct kvec *vec, size_t num, size_t size, int flags);``
  * ``int sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg);``
  * ``int kernel_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, struct kvec *vec, size_t num, size_t size);``

The message sending/receiving functions will then call the ``sendmsg``/
``recvmsg`` function in the ``ops`` field of the socket. Functions
containing ``kernel_`` as a prefix are used when the socket is used in the
kernel.

The parameters are:

  * ``msg``, a :c:type:`struct msghdr` structure, containing the message to be
    sent/received. Among the important components of this structure are ``msg_name``
    and ``msg_namelen``, which, for UDP sockets, must be filled in with the address
    to which the message is sent (:c:type:`struct sockaddr_in`);
  * ``vec``, a :c:type:`struct kvec` structure, containing a pointer to the buffer
    containing its data and size; as can be seen, it has a similar structure to the
    :c:type:`struct iovec` structure (the :c:type:`struct iovec` structure
    corresponds to the user space data, and the :c:type:`struct kvec` structure
    corresponds to kernel space data).

A usage example can be seen in the :c:func:`sys_sendto` system call handler:

.. code-block:: c

  SYSCALL_DEFINE6(sendto, int, fd, void __user *, buff, size_t, len,
  		unsigned int, flags, struct sockaddr __user *, addr,
  		int, addr_len)
  {
  	struct socket *sock;
  	struct sockaddr_storage address;
  	int err;
  	struct msghdr msg;
  	struct iovec iov;
  	int fput_needed;

  	err = import_single_range(WRITE, buff, len, &iov, &msg.msg_iter);
  	if (unlikely(err))
  		return err;
  	sock = sockfd_lookup_light(fd, &err, &fput_needed);
  	if (!sock)
  		goto out;

  	msg.msg_name = NULL;
  	msg.msg_control = NULL;
  	msg.msg_controllen = 0;
  	msg.msg_namelen = 0;
  	if (addr) {
  		err = move_addr_to_kernel(addr, addr_len, &address);
  		if (err < 0)
  			goto out_put;
  		msg.msg_name = (struct sockaddr *)&address;
  		msg.msg_namelen = addr_len;
  	}
  	if (sock->file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK)
  		flags |= MSG_DONTWAIT;
  	msg.msg_flags = flags;
  	err = sock_sendmsg(sock, &msg);

  out_put:
  	fput_light(sock->file, fput_needed);
  out:
  	return err;
  }

The :c:type:`struct socket` fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: c

  /**
   *  struct socket - general BSD socket
   *  @state: socket state (%SS_CONNECTED, etc)
   *  @type: socket type (%SOCK_STREAM, etc)
   *  @flags: socket flags (%SOCK_NOSPACE, etc)
   *  @ops: protocol specific socket operations
   *  @file: File back pointer for gc
   *  @sk: internal networking protocol agnostic socket representation
   *  @wq: wait queue for several uses
   */
  struct socket {
  	socket_state		state;

  	short			type;

  	unsigned long		flags;

  	struct socket_wq __rcu	*wq;

  	struct file		*file;
  	struct sock		*sk;
  	const struct proto_ops	*ops;
  };

The noteworthy fields are:

  * ``ops`` - the structure that stores pointers to protocol-specific functions;
  * ``sk`` - The ``INET socket`` associated with it.

The :c:type:`struct proto_ops` structure
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :c:type:`struct proto_ops` structure contains the implementations of the specific
operations implemented (TCP, UDP, etc.); these functions will be called from
generic functions through :c:type:`struct socket` (:c:func:`sock_release`,
:c:func:`sock_sendmsg`, etc.)

The :c:type:`struct proto_ops` structure therefore contains a number of function
pointers for specific protocol implementations:

.. code-block:: c

  struct proto_ops {
  	int		family;
  	struct module	*owner;
  	int		(*release)   (struct socket *sock);
  	int		(*bind)      (struct socket *sock,
  				      struct sockaddr *myaddr,
  				      int sockaddr_len);
  	int		(*connect)   (struct socket *sock,
  				      struct sockaddr *vaddr,
  				      int sockaddr_len, int flags);
  	int		(*socketpair)(struct socket *sock1,
  				      struct socket *sock2);
  	int		(*accept)    (struct socket *sock,
  				      struct socket *newsock, int flags, bool kern);
  	int		(*getname)   (struct socket *sock,
  				      struct sockaddr *addr,
  				      int peer);
  	//...
  }

The initialization of the ``ops`` field from :c:type:`struct socket` is done in
the :c:func:`__sock_create` function, by calling the :c:func:`create` function,
specific to each protocol; an equivalent call is the implementation of the
:c:func:`__sock_create` function:

.. code-block:: c

  //...
  	err = pf->create(net, sock, protocol, kern);
  	if (err < 0)
  		goto out_module_put;
  //...

This will instantiate the function pointers with calls specific to the protocol
type associated with the socket. The :c:func:`sock_register` and
:c:func:`sock_unregister` calls are used to fill the ``net_families`` vector.

For the rest of the socket operations (other than creating, closing, and
sending/receiving a message as described above in the `Operations on the socket
structure`_ section), the functions sent via pointers in this structure will be
called. For example, for ``bind``, which associates a socket with a socket on
the local machine, we will have the following code sequence:

.. code-block:: c

  #define MY_PORT 60000

  struct sockaddr_in addr = {
  	.sin_family = AF_INET,
  	.sin_port = htons (MY_PORT),
  	.sin_addr = { htonl (INADDR_LOOPBACK) }
  };

  //...
  	err = sock->ops->bind (sock, (struct sockaddr *) &addr, sizeof(addr));
  	if (err < 0) {
  		/* handle error */
  	}
  //...

As you can see, for transmitting the address and port information that
will be associated with the socket, a :c:type:`struct sockaddr_in` is filled.

The :c:type:`struct sock` structure
-----------------------------------

The :c:type:`struct sock` describes an ``INET`` socket. Such a structure is
associated with a user space socket and implicitly with a :c:type:`struct
socket` structure. The structure is used to store information about the status
of a connection. The structure's fields and associated operations usually begin
with the ``sk_`` string. Some fields are listed below:

.. code-block:: c

  struct sock {
  	//...
  	unsigned int		sk_padding : 1,
  				sk_no_check_tx : 1,
  				sk_no_check_rx : 1,
  				sk_userlocks : 4,
  				sk_protocol  : 8,
  				sk_type      : 16;
  	//...
  	struct socket		*sk_socket;
  	//...
  	struct sk_buff		*sk_send_head;
  	//...
  	void			(*sk_state_change)(struct sock *sk);
  	void			(*sk_data_ready)(struct sock *sk);
  	void			(*sk_write_space)(struct sock *sk);
  	void			(*sk_error_report)(struct sock *sk);
  	int			(*sk_backlog_rcv)(struct sock *sk,
  						  struct sk_buff *skb);
  	void                    (*sk_destruct)(struct sock *sk);
  };

\

  * ``sk_protocol`` is the type of protocol used by the socket;
  * ``sk_type`` is the socket type (``SOCK_STREAM``, ``SOCK_DGRAM``, etc.);
  * ``sk_socket`` is the BSD socket that holds it;
  * ``sk_send_head`` is the list of :c:type:`struct sk_buff` structures for
    transmission;
  * the function pointers at the end are callbacks for different situations.

Initializing the :c:type:`struct sock` and attaching it to a BSD socket is done
using the callback created from ``net_families`` (called
:c:func:`__sock_create`). Here's how to initialize the :c:type:`struct sock`
structure for the IP protocol, in the :c:func:`inet_create` function:

.. code-block:: c

  /*
   *	Create an inet socket.
   */

  static int inet_create(struct net *net, struct socket *sock, int protocol,
  		       int kern)
  {

  	struct sock *sk;

  	//...
  	err = -ENOBUFS;
  	sk = sk_alloc(net, PF_INET, GFP_KERNEL, answer_prot, kern);
  	if (!sk)
  		goto out;

  	err = 0;
  	if (INET_PROTOSW_REUSE & answer_flags)
  		sk->sk_reuse = SK_CAN_REUSE;


  	//...
  	sock_init_data(sock, sk);

  	sk->sk_destruct	   = inet_sock_destruct;
  	sk->sk_protocol	   = protocol;
  	sk->sk_backlog_rcv = sk->sk_prot->backlog_rcv;
  	//...
  }

.. _StructSKBuff:

The :c:type:`struct sk_buff` structure
--------------------------------------

The :c:type:`struct sk_buff` (socket buffer) describes a network packet. The
structure fields contain information about both the header and packet contents,
the protocols used, the network device used, and pointers to the other
:c:type:`struct sk_buff`. A summary description of the content of the structure
is presented below:

.. code-block:: c

  struct sk_buff {
  	union {
  		struct {
  			/* These two members must be first. */
  			struct sk_buff		*next;
  			struct sk_buff		*prev;

  			union {
  				struct net_device	*dev;
  				/* Some protocols might use this space to store information,
  				 * while device pointer would be NULL.
  				 * UDP receive path is one user.
  				 */
  				unsigned long		dev_scratch;
  			};
  		};

  		struct rb_node	rbnode; /* used in netem & tcp stack */
  	};
  	struct sock		*sk;

          union {
    		ktime_t		tstamp;
  		u64		skb_mstamp;
  	};

  	/*
  	 * This is the control buffer. It is free to use for every
  	 * layer. Please put your private variables there. If you
  	 * want to keep them across layers you have to do a skb_clone()
  	 * first. This is owned by whoever has the skb queued ATM.
  	 */
  	char			cb[48] __aligned(8);

  	unsigned long		_skb_refdst;
  	void			(*destructor)(struct sk_buff *skb);
          union {
           	struct {
    			unsigned long	_skb_refdst;
  			void		(*destructor)(struct sk_buff *skb);
  		};
  		struct list_head	tcp_tsorted_anchor;
  	};
  	/* ... */

  	unsigned int		len,
  				data_len;
  	__u16			mac_len,
  				hdr_len;

           /* ... */

  	__be16			protocol;
  	__u16			transport_header;
  	__u16			network_header;
  	__u16			mac_header;

  	/* private: */
  	__u32			headers_end[0];
  	/* public: */

  	/* These elements must be at the end, see alloc_skb() for details.  */
  	sk_buff_data_t		tail;
  	sk_buff_data_t		end;
  	unsigned char		*head,
  				*data;
  	unsigned int		truesize;
  	refcount_t		users;
  };

where:

  * ``next`` and ``prev`` are pointers to the next, and previous element in the
    buffer list;
  * ``dev`` is the device which sends or receives the buffer;
  * ``sk`` is the socket associated with the buffer;
  * ``destructor`` is the callback that deallocates the buffer;
  * ``transport_header``, ``network_header``, and ``mac_header`` are offsets
    between the beginning of the packet and the beginning of the various headers
    in the packets. They are internally maintained by the various processing
    layers through which the packet passes. To get pointers to the headers, use
    one of the following functions: :c:func:`tcp_hdr`, :c:func:`udp_hdr`,
    :c:func:`ip_hdr`, etc. In principle, each protocol provides a function to
    get a reference to the header of that protocol within a received packet.
    Keep in mind that the ``network_header`` field is not set until the packet
    reaches the network layer and the ``transport_header`` field is not set
    until the packet reaches the transport layer.

The structure of an `IP header <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Header>`_
(:c:type:`struct iphdr`) has the following fields:

.. code-block:: c

  struct iphdr {
  #if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
  	__u8	ihl:4,
  		version:4;
  #elif defined (__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
  	__u8	version:4,
    		ihl:4;
  #else
  #error	"Please fix <asm/byteorder.h>"
  #endif
  	__u8	tos;
  	__be16	tot_len;
  	__be16	id;
  	__be16	frag_off;
  	__u8	ttl;
  	__u8	protocol;
  	__sum16	check;
  	__be32	saddr;
  	__be32	daddr;
  	/*The options start here. */
  };

where:

  * ``protocol`` is the transport layer protocol used;
  * ``saddr`` is the source IP address;
  * ``daddr`` is the destination IP address.

The structure of a `TCP header
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure>`_
(:c:type:`struct tcphdr`) has the following fields:

.. code-block:: c

  struct tcphdr {
  	__be16	source;
  	__be16	dest;
  	__be32	seq;
  	__be32	ack_seq;
  #if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
  	__u16	res1:4,
  		doff:4,
  		fin:1,
  		syn:1,
  		rst:1,
  		psh:1,
  		ack:1,
  		urg:1,
  		ece:1,
  		cwr:1;
  #elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
  	__u16	doff:4,
  		res1:4,
  		cwr:1,
  		ece:1,
  		urg:1,
  		ack:1,
  		psh:1,
  		rst:1,
  		syn:1,
  		fin:1;
  #else
  #error	"Adjust your <asm/byteorder.h> defines"
  #endif
  	__be16	window;
  	__sum16	check;
  	__be16	urg_ptr;
  };

where:

  * ``source`` is the source port;
  * ``dest`` is the destination port;
  * ``syn``, ``ack``, ``fin`` are the TCP flags used; for a more detailed view,
    see this `diagram
    <http://www.eventhelix.com/Realtimemantra/Networking/Tcp.pdf>`_.

The structure of a `UDP header
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#Packet_structure>`_
(:c:type:`struct udphdr`) has the following fields:

.. code-block:: c

  struct udphdr {
  	__be16	source;
  	__be16	dest;
  	__be16	len;
  	__sum16	check;
  };

where:

  * ``source`` is the source port;
  * ``dest`` is the destination port.

An example of accessing the information present in the headers of a network
packet is as follows:

.. code-block:: c

  	struct sk_buff *skb;

  	struct iphdr *iph = ip_hdr(skb);                 /* IP header */
  	/* iph->saddr  - source IP address */
  	/* iph->daddr  - destination IP address */
  	if (iph->protocol == IPPROTO_TCP) {              /* TCP protocol */
  		struct tcphdr *tcph = tcp_hdr(skb);      /* TCP header */
  		/* tcph->source  - source TCP port */
  		/* tcph->dest    - destination TCP port */
  	} else if (iph->protocol == IPPROTO_UDP) {       /* UDP protocol */
  		struct udphdr *udph = udp_hdr(skb);      /* UDP header */
  		/* udph->source  - source UDP port */
  		/* udph->dest    - destination UDP port */
  	}

.. _Conversions:

Conversions
===========

In different systems, there are several ways of ordering bytes in a word
(`Endianness <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness>`_), including: `Big
Endian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Big-endian>`_ (the most
significant byte first) and `Little
Endian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian>`_ (the least
significant byte first). Since a network interconnects systems with different
platforms, the Internet has imposed a standard sequence for the storage of
numerical data, called `network byte-order
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Endianness_in_networking>`_. In
contrast, the byte sequence for the representation of numerical data on the host
computer is called host byte-order. Data received/sent from/to the network is in
the network byte-order format and should be converted between this format and
the host byte-order.

For converting we use the following macros:

  * ``u16 htons(u16 x)`` converts a 16 bit integer from host byte-order to
    network byte-order (host to network short);
  * ``u32 htonl(u32 x)`` converts a 32 bit integer from host byte-order to
    network byte-order (host to network long);
  * ``u16 ntohs(u16 x)`` converts a 16 bit integer from network byte-order to
    host byte-order (network to host short);
  * ``u32 ntohl(u32 x)`` converts a 32 bit integer from network byte-order to
    host byte-order (network to host long).

.. _netfilter:

netfilter
=========

Netfilter is the name of the kernel interface for capturing network packets for
modifying/analyzing them (for filtering, NAT, etc.). `The netfilter
<http://www.netfilter.org/>`_ interface is used in user space by `iptables
<http://www.frozentux.net/documents/iptables-tutorial/>`_.

In the Linux kernel, packet capture using netfilter is done by attaching hooks.
Hooks can be specified in different locations in the path followed by a kernel
network packet, as needed. An organization chart with the route followed by a
package and the possible areas for a hook can be found `here
<http://linux-ip.net/nf/nfk-traversal.png>`_.

The header included when using netfilter is :file:`linux/netfilter.h`.

A hook is defined through the :c:type:`struct nf_hook_ops` structure:

.. code-block:: c

  struct nf_hook_ops {
  	/* User fills in from here down. */
  	nf_hookfn               *hook;
  	struct net_device       *dev;
  	void                    *priv;
  	u_int8_t                pf;
  	unsigned int            hooknum;
  	/* Hooks are ordered in ascending priority. */
  	int                     priority;
  };

where:

  * ``pf`` is the package type (``PF_INET``, etc.);
  * ``priority`` is the priority; priorities are defined in
     :file:`uapi/linux/netfilter_ipv4.h` as follows:

.. code-block:: c

  enum nf_ip_hook_priorities {
  	NF_IP_PRI_FIRST = INT_MIN,
  	NF_IP_PRI_CONNTRACK_DEFRAG = -400,
  	NF_IP_PRI_RAW = -300,
  	NF_IP_PRI_SELINUX_FIRST = -225,
  	NF_IP_PRI_CONNTRACK = -200,
  	NF_IP_PRI_MANGLE = -150,
  	NF_IP_PRI_NAT_DST = -100,
  	NF_IP_PRI_FILTER = 0,
  	NF_IP_PRI_SECURITY = 50,
  	NF_IP_PRI_NAT_SRC = 100,
  	NF_IP_PRI_SELINUX_LAST = 225,
  	NF_IP_PRI_CONNTRACK_HELPER = 300,
  	NF_IP_PRI_CONNTRACK_CONFIRM = INT_MAX,
  	NF_IP_PRI_LAST = INT_MAX,
  };

\


  * ``dev`` is the device (network interface) on which the capture is
    intended;


  * ``hooknum`` is the type of hook used. When a packet is captured, the
    processing mode is defined by the ``hooknum`` and ``hook`` fields. For IP,
    hook types are defined in :file:`linux/netfilter.h`:

.. code-block:: c

  enum nf_inet_hooks {
  	NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING,
  	NF_INET_LOCAL_IN,
  	NF_INET_FORWARD,
  	NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT,
  	NF_INET_POST_ROUTING,
  	NF_INET_NUMHOOKS
  };

\

  * ``hook`` is the handler called when capturing a network packet (packet sent
    as a :c:type:`struct sk_buff` structure). The ``private`` field is private information
    handed to the handler. The capture handler prototype is defined by the
    :c:type:`nf_hookfn` type:

.. code-block:: c

  struct nf_hook_state {
  	unsigned int hook;
  	u_int8_t pf;
  	struct net_device *in;
  	struct net_device *out;
  	struct sock *sk;
  	struct net *net;
  	int (*okfn)(struct net *, struct sock *, struct sk_buff *);
  };

  typedef unsigned int nf_hookfn(void *priv,
  			       struct sk_buff *skb,
  			       const struct nf_hook_state *state);

For the :c:func:`nf_hookfn` capture function, the ``priv`` parameter is the
private information with which the :c:type:`struct nf_hook_ops` was
initialized. ``skb`` is the pointer to the captured network packet. Based on
``skb`` information, packet filtering decisions are made. The function's
``state`` parameter is the status information related to the packet capture,
including the input interface, the output interface, the priority, the hook
number. Priority and hook number are useful for allowing the same function to
be called by several hooks.

A capture handler can return one of the constants ``NF_*``:

.. code-block:: c

  /* Responses from hook functions. */
  #define NF_DROP 0
  #define NF_ACCEPT 1
  #define NF_STOLEN 2
  #define NF_QUEUE 3
  #define NF_REPEAT 4
  #define NF_STOP 5
  #define NF_MAX_VERDICT NF_STOP

``NF_DROP`` is used to filter (ignore) a packet, and ``NF_ACCEPT`` is used to
accept a packet and forward it.

Registering/unregistering a hook is done using the functions defined in
:file:`linux/netfilter.h`:

.. code-block:: c

  /* Function to register/unregister hook points. */
  int nf_register_net_hook(struct net *net, const struct nf_hook_ops *ops);
  void nf_unregister_net_hook(struct net *net, const struct nf_hook_ops *ops);
  int nf_register_net_hooks(struct net *net, const struct nf_hook_ops *reg,
  			  unsigned int n);
  void nf_unregister_net_hooks(struct net *net, const struct nf_hook_ops *reg,
  			     unsigned int n);


.. attention::

  Prior to version 3.11-rc2 of the Linux kernel,
  there are some restrictions related to the use of header extraction functions
  from a :c:type:`struct sk_buff` structure set as a parameter in a netfilter
  hook. While the IP header can be obtained each time using :c:func:`ip_hdr`,
  the TCP and UDP headers can be obtained with :c:func:`tcp_hdr` and
  :c:func:`udp_hdr` only for packages that come from inside the system rather
  than the ones that are received from outside the system. In the latter case,
  you must manually calculate the header offset in the package:

  .. code-block:: c

    // For TCP packets (iph->protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
    tcph = (struct tcphdr*)((__u32*)iph + iph->ihl);
    // For UDP packets (iph->protocol == IPPROTO_UDP)
    udph = (struct udphdr*)((__u32*)iph + iph->ihl);

  This code works in all filtering situations, so it's recommended to use it
  instead of header access functions.

A usage example for a netfilter hook is shown below:

.. code-block:: c

  #include <linux/netfilter.h>
  #include <linux/netfilter_ipv4.h>
  #include <linux/net.h>
  #include <linux/in.h>
  #include <linux/skbuff.h>
  #include <linux/ip.h>
  #include <linux/tcp.h>

  static unsigned int my_nf_hookfn(void *priv,
  		struct sk_buff *skb,
  		const struct nf_hook_state *state)
  {
  	/* process packet */
  	//...

  	return NF_ACCEPT;
  }

  static struct nf_hook_ops my_nfho = {
  	.hook        = my_nf_hookfn,
  	.hooknum     = NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT,
  	.pf          = PF_INET,
  	.priority    = NF_IP_PRI_FIRST
  };

  int __init my_hook_init(void)
  {
  	return nf_register_net_hook(&init_net, &my_nfho);
  }

  void __exit my_hook_exit(void)
  {
  	nf_unregister_net_hook(&init_net, &my_nfho);
  }

  module_init(my_hook_init);
  module_exit(my_hook_exit);

netcat
======

When developing applications that include networking code, one of the most
used tools is netcat. Also nicknamed "Swiss-army knife for TCP / IP". It allows:

  * Initiating TCP connections;
  * Waiting for a TCP connection;
  * Sending and receiving UDP packets;
  * Displaying traffic in hexdump format;
  * Run a program after establishing a connection (eg, a shell);
  * Set special options in sent packages.

Initiating TCP connections:

.. code-block:: console

  nc hostname port

Listening to a TCP port:

.. code-block:: console

  nc -l -p port

Sending and receiving UDP packets is done adding the ``-u`` command line option.

.. note::

  The command is :command:`nc`; often :command:`netcat` is an alias for this
  command. There are other implementations of the netcat command, some of which
  have slightly different parameters than the classic implementation. Run
  :command:`man nc` or :command:`nc -h` to check how to use it.

For more information on netcat, check the following `tutorial
<https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/netcat_tutorial.pdf>`_.

.. important::

  You need to make sure that the ``netfilter`` support is active in kernel. It
  is enabled via ``CONFIG_NETFILTER``. To activate it, run :command:`make menuconfig` in
  the :file:`linux` directory and check the ``Network packet filtering framework
  (Netfilter)`` option in ``Networking support -> Networking options``. If it
  was not enabled, enable it (as builtin, not external module - it must be
  marked with ``*``).


1. Displaying packets in kernel space
-------------------------------------

Write a kernel module that displays the source address and port for TCP packets
that initiate an outbound connection. Start from the code in
:file:`1-2-netfilter` and fill in the areas marked with ``TODO 1``, taking into
account the comments below.

You will need to register a netfilter hook of type ``NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT`` as explained
in the `netfilter`_ section.

`The struct sk_buff structure`_ lets you access the packet headers using
specific functions. The :c:func:`ip_hdr` function returns the IP header as a
pointer to a :c:type:`struct iphdr` structure. The :c:func:`tcp_hdr` function
returns the TCP header as a pointer to a :c:type:`struct tcphdr` structure.

The `diagram`_ explains how to make a TCP connection. The connection initiation
packet has the ``SYN`` flag set in the TCP header and the ``ACK`` flag cleared.

.. note::

  To display the source IP address, use the ``%pI4`` format of the printk
  function. Details can be found in the `kernel documentation
  <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/printk-formats.txt>`_ (``IPv4
  addresses`` section). The following is an example code snippet that uses
  ``%pI4``:

  .. code-block:: c

    printk("IP address is %pI4\n", &iph->saddr);

  When using the ``%pI4`` format, the argument to printk is a pointer. Hence the
  construction ``&iph->saddr`` (with operator & - ampersand) instead of
  ``iph->saddr``.

The source TCP port is, in the TCP header, in the `network byte-order`_ format.
Read through the :ref:`Conversions` section. Use :c:func:`ntohs` to convert.

For testing, use the :file:`1-2-netfilter/user/test-1.sh` file. The test creates
a connection to the localhost, a connection that will be intercepted and
displayed by the kernel module. The script is copied on the virtual machine by
the :command:`make copy` command only if it is marked as executable. The script
uses the statically compiled :command:`netcat` tool stored in
:file:`skels/networking/netcat`; this program must have execution
permissions.

After running the checker the output should be similar to the one bellow:

.. code-block:: c

  # ./test-1.sh
  [  229.783512] TCP connection initiated from 127.0.0.1:44716
  Should show up in filter.
  Check dmesg output.

2. Filtering by destination address
-----------------------------------

Extend the module from exercise 1 so that you can specify a destination address
by means of a ``MY_IOCTL_FILTER_ADDRESS`` ioctl call. You'll only show packages
containing the specified destination address. To solve this task, fill in the
areas marked with ``TODO 2`` and follow the specifications below.

To implement the ioctl routine, you must fill out the ``my_ioctl`` function.
Review the section in :ref:`ioctl`. The address sent from user space is in
`network byte-order`_, so there will be **NO need** for conversion.

.. note::

  The IP address sent via ``ioctl`` is sent by address, not by value. The
  address must be stored in the ``ioctl_set_addr`` variable. For copying use
  :c:func:`copy_from_user`.

To compare the addresses, fill out the ``test_daddr`` function. Addresses in
network byte-order will be used without having to convert addresses (if they
are equal from left to right they will be equal if reversed too).

The ``test_daddr`` function must be called from the netfilter hook to display
the connection initialization packets for which the destination address is the
one sent through the ioctl routine. The connection initiation packet has the
``SYN`` flag set in the TCP header and the ``ACK`` flag cleared.  You have to
check two things:

  * the TCP flags;
  * the destination address of the packet (using ``test_addr``).

For testing, use the :file:`1-2-netfilter/user/test-2.sh` script. This script
needs to compile the :file:`1-2-netfilter/user/test.c` file in the test
executable. Compilation is done automatically on the physical system when
running the :command:`make build` command. The test script is copied to the
virtual machine only if it is marked as executable. The script uses the
statically compiled :command:`netcat` tool in :file:`skels/networking/netcat`;
this executable must have execution permissions.

After running the checker the output should be similar to the one bellow:

.. code-block:: console

  # ./test-2.sh
  [  797.673535] TCP connection initiated from 127.0.0.1:44721
  Should show up in filter.
  Should NOT show up in filter.
  Check dmesg output.

The test ask for packet filtering first for the ``127.0.0.1`` IP address and
then for the ``127.0.0.2`` IP address. The first connection initiation packet
(to ``127.0.0.1``) is intercepted and displayed by the filter, while the second
(to ``127.0.0.2``) is not intercepted.

3. Listening on a TCP socket
----------------------------

Write a kernel module that creates a TCP socket that listens to connections on
port ``60000`` on the loopback interface (in ``init_module``). Start from the
code in :file:`3-4-tcp-sock` fill in the areas marked with ``TODO 1`` taking
into account the observations below.

Read the `Operations on the socket structure`_ and `The struct proto_ops
structure`_ sections.

The ``sock`` socket is a ``server socket`` and must be put in the listening
state. That is, the ``bind`` and ``listen`` operations must be applied to the
socket. For the ``bind`` and ``listen`` equivalent, in kernel space you will
need to call ``sock->ops->...;`` examples of such functions you can call are
``sock->ops->bind``, ``sock->ops->listen`` etc.

.. note::

  For example, call ``sock->ops->bind``, or ``sock->ops->listen`` functions, see
  how they are called in the :c:func:`sys_bind` and :c:func:`sys_listen` system
  call handlers.

  Look for the system call handlers in the ``net/socket.c`` file in the Linux
  kernel source code tree.

.. note::

  For the second argument of the ``listen`` (backlog) call, use the
  ``LISTEN_BACKLOG``.

Remember to release the socket in the module's exit function and in the area
marked with error labels; use :c:func:`sock_release`.

For testing, run the :command:`3-4-tcp_sock/test-3.sh` script. The script is
copied on the virtual machine by :command:`make copy` only if it is marked as
executable.

After running the test, a TCP socket will be displayed by listening to
connections on port ``60000``.

4. Accepting connections in kernel space
----------------------------------------

Expand the module from the previous exercise to allow an external connection (no
need to send any message, only accept new connections). Fill in the areas marked
with ``TODO 2``.

Read the `Operations on the socket structure`_ and `The struct proto_ops
structure`_ sections.

For the kernel space ``accept`` equivalent, see the system call handler for
:c:func:`sys_accept4`. Follow the `lnet_sock_accept
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.17/source/drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/lib-socket.c#L511>`_
implementation, and how the ``sock->ops->accept`` call is used. Use ``0`` as
the value for the second to last argument (``flags``), and ``true`` for the
last argument (``kern``).

.. note::

  Look for the system call handlers in the ``net/socket.c`` file in the Linux
  kernel source code tree.

.. note::

  The new socket (``new_sock``) must be created with the
  :c:func:`sock_create_lite` function and then its operations must be configured
  using

  .. code-block:: console

    newsock->ops = sock->ops;

Print the address and port of the destination socket. To find the peer name of a
socket (its address), refer to the :c:func:`sys_getpeername` system call handler.

.. note::

  The first argument for the ``sock->ops->getname`` function will be the
  connection socket, ie ``new_sock``, the one initialized with by the ``accept``
  call.

  The last argument of the ``sock->ops->getname`` function will be ``1``,
  meaning that we want to know about the endpoint or the peer (*remote end* or
  *peer*).

  Display the peer address (indicated by the ``raddr`` variable) using the
  ``print_sock_address`` macro defined in the file.

Release the newly created socket (after accepting the connection) in the module
exit function and after the error label. After adding the ``accept`` code to the
module initialization function, the :command:`insmod` operation will lock until
a connection is established. You can unlock using :command:`netcat` on that
port. Consequently, the test script from the previous exercise will not work.

For testing, run the :file:`3-4-tcp_sock/test-4.sh` script. The script is copied on
the virtual machine by :command:`make copy` only if it is marked as executable.

Nothing special will be displayed (in the kernel buffer). The success of the
test will be defined by the connection establishment. Then use ``Ctrl+c`` to
stop the test script, and then you can remove the kernel module.

5. UDP socket sender
--------------------

Write a kernel module that creates a UDP socket and sends the message from the
``MY_TEST_MESSAGE`` macro on the socket to the loopback address on port
``60001``.

Start from the code in :file:`5-udp-sock`.

Read the `Operations on the socket structure`_ and `The struct proto_ops
structure`_ sections.

To see how to send messages in the kernel space, see the :c:func:`sys_send`
system call handler or `Sending/receiving messages`_.

.. hint::

  The ``msg_name`` field of the :c:type:`struct msghdr` structure must be
  initialized to the destination address (pointer to :c:type:`struct sockaddr`)
  and the ``msg_namelen`` field to the address size.

  Initialize the ``msg_flags`` field of the :c:type:`struct msghdr` structure
  to ``0``.

  Initialize the ``msg_control`` and ``msg_controllen`` fields of the
  :c:type:`struct msghdr` structure to ``NULL`` and ``0`` respectively.

For sending the message use :c:func:`kernel_sendmsg`.

The message transmission parameters are retrieved from the kernel space. Cast
the :c:type:`struct iovec` structure pointer to a :c:type:`struct kvec` pointer
in the :c:func:`kernel_sendmsg` call.

.. hint::

  The last two parameters of :c:func:`kernel_sendmsg` are ``1`` (number of I/O
  vectors) and ``len`` (message size).

For testing, use the :file:`test-5.sh` file. The script is copied on the virtual
machine by the :command:`make copy` command only if it is marked as executable.
The script uses the statically compiled ``netcat`` tool stored in
:file:`skels/networking/netcat`; this executable must have execution
permissions.

For a correct implementation, running the :file:`test-5.sh` script will cause
the ``kernelsocket`` message to be displayed like in the output below:

.. code-block:: console

  /root # ./test-5.sh
  + pid=1059
  + sleep 1
  + nc -l -u -p 60001
  + insmod udp_sock.ko
  kernelsocket
  + rmmod udp_sock
  + kill 1059
