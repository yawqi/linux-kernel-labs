   To solve exercises, you need to perform these steps:

      * prepare skeletons from templates
      * build modules
      * copy modules to the VM
      * start the VM and test the module in the VM.

   The current lab name is |LAB_NAME|. See the exercises for the task name.

   The skeleton code is generated from full source examples located in
   :file:`tools/labs/templates`. To solve the tasks, start by generating
   the skeleton code for a complete lab:

   .. code-block:: shell

      tools/labs $ make clean
      tools/labs $ LABS=<lab name> make skels

   You can also generate the skeleton for a single task, using

   .. code-block:: shell

      tools/labs $ LABS=<lab name>/<task name> make skels

   Once the skeleton drivers are generated, build the source:

   .. code-block:: shell

      tools/labs $ make build

   Then, copy the modules and start the VM:

   .. code-block:: shell

      tools/labs $ make copy
      tools/labs $ make boot

   The modules are placed in /home/root/skels/|LAB_NAME|/<task_name>.

   Alternatively, we can copy files via :command:`scp`, in order to avoid restarting the VM.
   For additional details about connecting to the VM via the network, please check :ref:`vm_interaction_link`.

   Review the `Exercises`_ section for more detailed information.

.. warning::

   Before starting the exercises or generating the skeletons, please run **git pull** inside the Linux repo,
   to make sure you have the latest version of the exercises.

   If you have local changes, the pull command will fail. Check for local changes using ``git status``.
   If you want to keep them, run ``git stash`` before ``pull`` and ``git stash pop`` after.
   To discard the changes, run ``git reset --hard master``.

   If you already generated the skeleton before ``git pull`` you will need to generate it again.
