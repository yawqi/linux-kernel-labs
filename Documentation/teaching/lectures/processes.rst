Processes and threads
=====================

A process is an operating system abstraction that groups together
multiple resources:

.. slide:: What is a process?
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 2

      * An address space
      * One or more threads
      * Opened files
      * Sockets
      * Semaphores
      * Shared memory regions
      * Timers
      * Signal handlers
      * Many other resources and status information

   All this information is grouped in the Process Control Group
   (PCB). In Linux this is :c:type:`struct task_struct`.


Overview of process resources
-----------------------------

A summary of the resources a process has can be obtain from the
`/proc/<pid>` directory, where `<pid>` is the process id for the
process we want to look at.

:c:type:`struct task_struct`
----------------------------

Lets take a close look at :c:type:`struct task_struct`. For that we
could just look at the source code, but here we will use a tool called
`pahole` (part of the dwarves install package) in order to get
some insights about this structure:


.. slide:: struct task_struct
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      $ pahole -C task_struct vmlinux

      struct task_struct {
          struct thread_info thread_info;                  /*     0     8 */
          volatile long int          state;                /*     8     4 */
          void *                     stack;                /*    12     4 */

          ...

          /* --- cacheline 45 boundary (2880 bytes) --- */
          struct thread_struct thread __attribute__((__aligned__(64))); /*  2880  4288 */

          /* size: 7168, cachelines: 112, members: 155 */
          /* sum members: 7148, holes: 2, sum holes: 12 */
          /* sum bitfield members: 7 bits, bit holes: 2, sum bit holes: 57 bits */
          /* paddings: 1, sum paddings: 2 */
          /* forced alignments: 6, forced holes: 2, sum forced holes: 12 */
      } __attribute__((__aligned__(64)));


As you can see it is a pretty large data structure: almost 8KB in size
and 155 fields.


Inspecting task_struct
----------------------

The following screencast is going to demonstrate how we can inspect
the process control block (:c:type:`struct task_struct`) by connecting
the debugger to the running virtual machine. We are going to use a
helper gdb command `lx-ps` to list the processes and the address of
the task_struct for each process.

Quiz: Inspect a task to determine opened files
----------------------------------------------

.. slide:: Quiz: Inspect opened files
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   Use the debugger to inspect the process named syslogd.

   * What command should we use to list the opened file descriptors?

   * How many file descriptors are opened?

   * What command should we use the determine the file name for opened file descriptor 3?

   * What is the filename for file descriptor 3?


Threads
-------

A thread is the basic unit that the kernel process scheduler uses to
allow applications to run the CPU. A thread has the following
characteristics:

.. slide:: Threads
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Each thread has its own stack and together with the register
     values it determines the thread execution state

   * A thread runs in the context of a process and all threads in the
     same process share the resources

   * The kernel schedules threads not processes and user-level threads
     (e.g. fibers, coroutines, etc.) are not visible at the kernel level


The typical thread implementation is one where the threads is
implemented as a separate data structure which is then linked to the
process data structure. For example, the Windows kernel uses such an
implementation:

Linux uses a different implementation for threads. The basic unit is
called a task (hence the :c:type:`struct task_struct`) and it is used
for both threads and processes. Instead of embedding resources in the
task structure it has pointers to these resources.

Thus, if two threads are the same process will point to the same
resource structure instance. If two threads are in different processes
they will point to different resource structure instances.

The clone system call
---------------------

In Linux a new thread or process is create with the :c:func:`clone`
system call. Both the :c:func:`fork` system call and the
:c:func:`pthread_create` function uses the :c:func:`clone`
implementation.

It allows the caller to decide what resources should be shared with
the parent and which should be copied or isolated:

.. slide:: The clone system call
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * CLONE_FILES - shares the file descriptor table with the parent

   * CLONE_VM - shares the address space with the parent

   * CLONE_FS - shares the filesystem information (root directory,
     current directory) with the parent

   * CLONE_NEWNS - does not share the mount namespace with the parent

   * CLONE_NEWIPC - does not share the IPC namespace (System V IPC
     objects, POSIX message queues) with the parent

   * CLONE_NEWNET - does not share the networking namespaces (network
     interfaces, routing table) with the parent


For example, if `CLONE_FILES | CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS` is used by the
caller than effectively a new thread is created. If these flags are
not used than a new process is created.

Namespaces and "containers"
---------------------------

"Containers" are a form of lightweight virtual machines that share the
same kernel instance, as opposed to normal virtualization where a
hypervisor runs multiple VMs, each with its one kernel
instance.

Examples of container technologies are LXC - that allows running
lightweight "VM" and docker - a specialized container for running a
single application.

Containers are built on top of a few kernel features, one of which is
namespaces. They allow isolation of different resources that would
otherwise be globally visible. For example, without containers, all
processes would be visible in /proc. With containers, processes in one
container will not be visible (in /proc or be killable) to other
containers.

To achieve this partitioning, the :c:type:`struct nsproxy` structure
is used to group types of resources that we want to partition. It
currently supports IPC, networking, cgroup, mount, networking, PID,
time namespaces. For example, instead of having a global list for
networking interfaces, the list is part of a :c:type:`struct net`. The
system initializes with a default namespace (:c:data:`init_net`) and by
default all processes will share this namespace. When a new namespace
is created a new net namespace is created and then new processes can
point to that new namespace instead of the default one.


.. slide:: Namespaces and "containers"
   :inline-contents: False
   :level: 2

   * Containers = a form of lightweight virtual machines

   * Container based technologies: LXC, docker

   * Containers are built of top of kernel namespaces

   * Kernel namespaces allows isolation of otherwise globally visible
     resources

   * :c:type:`struct nsproxy` has multiple namespaces each of which
     can be selectively shared between groups of processes

   * At boot initial namespaces are created (e.g. :c:data:`init_net`)
     that are by default shared between new processes (e.g. list of
     available network interfaces)

   * New namespace can be created a runtime and new processes can
     point to these new namespaces


Accessing the current process
-----------------------------

.. slide:: Accessing the current process
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   Accessing the current process is a frequent operation:

   * opening a file needs access to :c:type:`struct task_struct`'s
     file field

   * mapping a new file needs access to :c:type:`struct task_struct`'s
     mm field

   * Over 90% of the system calls needs to access the current process
     structure so it needs to be fast

   * The :c:macro:`current` macro is available to access to current
     process's :c:type:`struct task_struct`

In order to support fast access in multi processor configurations a
per CPU variable is used to store and retrieve the pointer to the
current :c:type:`struct task_struct`:

Note that before a context switch can occur we must do a kernel
transition, either with a system call or with an interrupt. At that
point the user space registers are saved on the kernel stack. At some
point the :c:func:`schedule` function will be called which can decide
that a context switch must occur from T0 to T1 (e.g. because the
current thread is blocking waiting for an I/O operation to complete or
because it's allocated time slice has expired).

At that point :c:func:`context_switch` will perform architecture
specific operations and will switch the address space if needed:


.. slide:: context_switch
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      static __always_inline struct rq *
      context_switch(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *prev,
               struct task_struct *next, struct rq_flags *rf)
      {
          prepare_task_switch(rq, prev, next);

          /*

          arch_start_context_switch(prev);

          /*

           *   user -> kernel   lazy + mmgrab() active

          if (!next->mm) {                                // to kernel
              enter_lazy_tlb(prev->active_mm, next);

              next->active_mm = prev->active_mm;
              if (prev->mm)                           // from user
                  mmgrab(prev->active_mm);
              else
                  prev->active_mm = NULL;
          } else {                                        // to user
              membarrier_switch_mm(rq, prev->active_mm, next->mm);
              /*
               * sys_membarrier() requires an smp_mb() between setting

               */
              switch_mm_irqs_off(prev->active_mm, next->mm, next);

              if (!prev->mm) {                        // from kernel
                  /* will mmdrop() in finish_task_switch(). */
                  rq->prev_mm = prev->active_mm;
                  prev->active_mm = NULL;
              }
          }

          rq->clock_update_flags &= ~(RQCF_ACT_SKIP|RQCF_REQ_SKIP);

          prepare_lock_switch(rq, next, rf);

          /* Here we just switch the register state and the stack. */
          switch_to(prev, next, prev);
          barrier();

          return finish_task_switch(prev);
        }


Then it will call the architecture specific :c:macro:`switch_to`
implementation to switch the registers state and kernel stack. Note
that registers are saved on stack and that the stack pointer is saved
in the task structure:

          ((last) = __switch_to_asm((prev), (next)));   \
      } while (0)

          #endif

          /* Restore flags or the incoming task to restore AC state. */
          popfl

          jmp     __switch_to
        SYM_CODE_END(__switch_to_asm)
        .popsection


You can notice that the instruction pointer is not explicitly
saved. It is not needed because:

  * a task will always resume in this function

  * the :c:func:`schedule` (:c:func:`context_switch` is always
    inlined) caller's return address is saved on the kernel stack

  * a jmp is used to execute :c:func:`__switch_to` which is a function
    and when it returns it will pop the original (next task) return
    address from the stack


The following screencast uses the debugger to setup a breaking in
__switch_to_asm and examine the stack during the context switch:

Blocking the current thread
---------------------------

Blocking the current thread is an important operation we need to
perform to implement efficient task scheduling - we want to run other
threads while I/O operations complete.

In order to accomplish this the following operations take place:

.. slide:: Blocking the current thread
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Set the current thread state to TASK_UINTERRUPTIBLE or
     TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE

   * Add the task to a waiting queue

   * Call the scheduler which will pick up a new task from the READY
     queue

   * Do the context switch to the new task

Below are some snippets for the :c:macro:`wait_event`
implementation. Note that the waiting queue is a list with some extra
information like a pointer to the task struct.

Also note that a lot of effort is put into making sure no deadlock can
occur between :c:macro:`wait_event` and :c:macro:`wake_up`: the task
is added to the list before checking :c:data:`condition`, signals are
checked before calling :c:func:`schedule`.

.. slide:: wait_event
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      /**
       * wait_event - sleep until a condition gets true
       * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
       * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
       *
       * The process is put to sleep (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) until the
       * @condition evaluates to true. The @condition is checked each time
       * the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
       *
       * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
       * change the result of the wait condition.

Preempting tasks
================

Up until this point we look at how context switches occurs voluntary
between threads. Next we will look at how preemption is handled. We
will start wight the simpler case where the kernel is configured as
non preemptive and then we will move to the preemptive kernel case.

Non preemptive kernel
---------------------

.. slide:: Non preemptive kernel
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * At every tick the kernel checks to see if the current process has
     its time slice consumed

   * If that happens a flag is set in interrupt context

   * Before returning to userspace the kernel checks this flag and
     calls :c:func:`schedule` if needed

   * In this case tasks are not preempted while running in kernel mode
     (e.g. system call) so there are no synchronization issues


Preemptive kernel
-----------------

In this case the current task can be preempted even if we are running
in kernel mode and executing a system call. This requires using a
special synchronization primitives: :c:macro:`preempt_disable` and
:c:macro:`preempt_enable`.

In order to simplify handling for preemptive kernels and since
synchronization primitives are needed for the SMP case anyway,
preemption is disabled automatically when a spinlock is used.

As before, if we run into a condition that requires the preemption of
the current task (its time slices has expired) a flag is set. This
flag is checked whenever the preemption is reactivated, e.g. when
exiting a critical section through a :c:func:`spin_unlock` and if
needed the scheduler is called to select a new task.


.. slide:: Preemptive kernel
   :inline-contents: False
   :level: 2

   * Tasks can be preempted even when running in kernel mode

   * It requires new synchronization primitives to be used in critical
     sections: :c:macro:`preempt_disable` and
     :c:macro:`preempt_enable`

   * Spinlocks also disable preemption

   * When a thread needs to be preempted a flag is set and action is
     taken (e.g. scheduler is called) when preemption is reactivated


Process context
===============

Now that we have examined the implementation of processes and threads
(tasks), how context switching occurs, how we can block, wake-up and
preempt tasks, we can finally define what the process context is what
are its properties:

.. slide:: Process context
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   The kernel is executing in process context when it is running a
   system call.

   In process context there is a well defined context and we can
   access the current process data with :c:macro:`current`

   In process context we can sleep (wait on a condition).

   In process context we can access the user-space (unless we are
   running in a kernel thread context).


Kernel threads
--------------

.. slide:: Kernel threads
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   Sometimes the kernel core or device drivers need to perform blocking
   operations and thus they need to run in process context.

   Kernel threads are used exactly for this and are a special class of
   tasks that don't "userspace" resources (e.g. no address space or
   opened files).


The following screencast takes a closer look at kernel threads:

.. slide:: Inspecting kernel threads
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   .. asciicast:: ../res/kernel_threads.cast


Using gdb scripts for kernel inspection
=======================================

The Linux kernel comes with a predefined set of gdb extra commands we
can use to inspect the kernel during debugging. They will
automatically be loaded as long gdbinit is properly setup

.. code-block:: sh

   ubuntu@so2:/linux/tools/labs$ cat ~/.gdbinit
   add-auto-load-safe-path /linux/scripts/gdb/vmlinux-gdb.py

All of the kernel specific commands are prefixed with lx-. You can use
TAB in gdb to list all of them:

.. code-block:: sh

   (gdb) lx-
   lx-clk-summary        lx-dmesg              lx-mounts
   lx-cmdline            lx-fdtdump            lx-ps
   lx-configdump         lx-genpd-summary      lx-symbols
   lx-cpus               lx-iomem              lx-timerlist
   lx-device-list-bus    lx-ioports            lx-version
   lx-device-list-class  lx-list-check
   lx-device-list-tree   lx-lsmod

The implementation of the commands can be found at
`script/gdb/linux`. Lets take a closer look at the lx-ps
implementation:


.. code-block:: python

   task_type = utils.CachedType("struct task_struct")


   def task_lists():
    task_ptr_type = task_type.get_type().pointer()
    init_task = gdb.parse_and_eval("init_task").address
    t = g = init_task

    while True:
        while True:
            yield t

            t = utils.container_of(t['thread_group']['next'],
                                   task_ptr_type, "thread_group")
            if t == g:
                break

        t = g = utils.container_of(g['tasks']['next'],
                                   task_ptr_type, "tasks")
        if t == init_task:
            return


    class LxPs(gdb.Command):
    """Dump Linux tasks."""

    def __init__(self):
        super(LxPs, self).__init__("lx-ps", gdb.COMMAND_DATA)

    def invoke(self, arg, from_tty):
