   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Physical Memory Management

     * Page allocations

     * Small allocations

   * Virtual Memory Management

   * Page Fault Handling Overview


Physical Memory Management
==========================

.. slide:: Physical Memory Management
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Algorithms and data structure that keep track of physical memory
     pages

   * Independent of virtual memory management

   * Both virtual and physical memory management is required for complete
     memory management

   * Physical pages are being tracked using a special data structure:
     :c:type:`struct page`

   * All physical pages have an entry reserved in the :c:data:`mem_map`
     vector

   * The physical page status may include: a counter for how many
     times is a page used, position in swap or file, buffers for this
     page, position int the page cache, etc.

Memory zones
------------

.. slide:: Memory zones
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * DMA zone

   * DMA32 zone

   * Normal zone (LowMem)

   * HighMem Zone

   * Movable Zone


Non-Uniform Memory Access
-------------------------

.. slide:: Non-Uniform Memory Access
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Physical memory is split in between multiple nodes, one for each CPU

   * There is single physical address space accessible from every node

   * Access to the local memory is faster

   * Each node maintains is own memory zones (.e. DMA, NORMAL, HIGHMEM, etc.)


Page allocation
---------------

.. slide:: Page allocation
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2


   .. code-block:: c

      /* Allocates 2^order contiguous pages and returns a pointer to the
       * descriptor for the first page
       */
      struct page *alloc_pages(gfp_mask, order);

      /* allocates a single page */
      struct page *alloc_page(gfp_mask);


      /* helper functions that return the kernel virtual address */
      void *__get_free_pages(gfp_mask, order);
      void *__get_free_page(gfp_mask);
      void *__get_zero_page(gfp_mask);
      void *__get_dma_pages(gfp_mask, order);


.. slide:: Why only allocate pages in chunks of power of 2?
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Typical memory allocation algorithms have linear complexity

   * Why not use paging?

     * Sometime we do need contiguous memory allocations (for DMA)

     * Allocation would require page table changes and TLB flushes

     * Not able to use extended pages

     * Some architecture directly (in hardware) linearly maps a part
       of the address space (e.g. MIPS)


.. slide:: The buddy algorithm
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Free blocks are distributed in multiple lists

   * Each list contains blocks of the same size

   * The block size is a power of two


.. slide:: Allocating a block of size N
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * If there is a free block in the N-size list, pick the first

   * If not, look for a free block in the 2N-size list

   * Split the 2N-size block in two N-size blocks and add them to the
     N-size block

   * Now that we have the N-size list populated, pick the first free
     block from that list


.. slide:: Freeing a block of size N
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * If the "buddy" is free coalesce into a 2N-size block

   * Try until no more free buddy block is found and place the
     resulting block in the respective list


.. slide:: The Linux implementation
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * 11 lists for blocks of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512,
     1024 pages

   * Each memory zone has its own buddy allocator

   * Each zone has a vector of descriptors for free blocks, one entry
     for each size

   * The descriptor contains the number of free blocks and the head of
     the list

   * Blocks are linked in the list using the `lru` field of
     :c:type:`struct page`

   * Free pages have the PG_buddy flag set

   * The page descriptor keeps a copy of the block size in the private
     field to easily check if the "buddy" is free


Small allocations
-----------------

.. slide:: Small allocations
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Buddy is used to allocate pages

   * Many of the kernel subsystems need to allocate buffers smaller
     than a page

   * Typical solution: variable size buffer allocation

     * Leads to external fragmentation

   * Alternative solution: fixed size buffer allocation

     * Leads to internal fragmentation

   * Compromise: fixed size block allocation with multiple sizes, geometrically distributed

     * e.g.: 32, 64, ..., 131056


.. slide:: The SLAB allocator
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Buffers = objects

   * Uses buddy to allocate a pool of pages for object allocations

   * Each object (optionally) has a constructor and destructor

   * Deallocated objects are cached - avoids subsequent calls for
     constructors and buddy allocation / deallocation

.. slide:: Why SLAB?
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * The kernel will typically allocate and deallocate multiple types
     the same data structures over time (e.g. :c:type:`struct
     task_struct`) effectively using fixed size allocations. Using the
     SLAB reduces the frequency of the more heavy
     allocation/deallocation operations.

   * For variable size buffers (which occurs less frequently) a
     geometric distribution of caches with fixed-size can be used

   * Reduces the memory allocation foot-print since we are searching a
     much smaller memory area, compared to buddy which can span over a
     larger area

   * Employs cache optimization techniques (slab coloring)


.. slide:: Slab architecture
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. image:: ../res/slab-overview.png


.. slide:: Cache descriptors
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * A name to identify the cache for stats

   * object constructor and destructor functions

   * size of the objects

   * Flags

   * Size of the slab in power of 2 pages

   * GFP masks

   * One or mores slabs, grouped by state: full, partially full, empty

.. slide:: SLAB descriptors
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Number of objects

   * Memory region where the objects are stored

   * Pointer to the first free object

   * Descriptor are stored either in

     * the SLAB itself (if the object size is lower the 512 or if
       internal fragmentation leaves enough space for the SLAB
       descriptor)

     * in generic caches internally used by the SLAB allocator


.. slide:: Slab detailed architecture
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. image:: ../res/slab-detailed-arch.png


.. slide:: Generic vs specific caches
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Generic caches are used internally by the slab allocator

     * allocating memory for cache and slab descriptors

   * They are also used to implement :c:func:`kmalloc` by implementing
     20 caches with object sizes geometrically distributed between
     32bytes and 4MB

   * Specific cache are created on demand by kernel subsystems


.. slide:: Object descriptors
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. image:: ../res/slab-object-descriptors.png

.. slide:: Object descriptors
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Only used for free objects

   * An integer that points to the next free object

   * The last free object uses a terminator value

   * Internal descriptors - stored in the slab

   * External descriptors - stored in generic caches


.. slide:: SLAB coloring
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. image:: ../res/slab-coloring.png


Virtual memory management
=========================

.. slide:: Virtual memory management
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Used in both kernel and user space

   * Using virtual memory requires:

     * reserving (allocating) a segment in the *virtual* address space
       (be it kernel or user)

     * allocating one or more physical pages for the buffer

     * allocating one or more physical pages for page tables and
       internal structures

     * mapping the virtual memory segment to the physical allocated
       pages

   :inline-contents: True
